//Add GlassFish to NetBeans:
Terminal:netbeans
In NetBeans, go to Services > Servers.
   Right-click and select Add Server.
   Choose GlassFish Server, navigate to the GlassFish installation directory (/opt/glassfish6), and add it.

//Create a SOAP-Based Web Service Project in NetBeans
  //Open NetBeans and create a new web application:

Select GlassFish Server and the Java EE version. Click Finish.
 //Create the Web Service:
      In the Projects window, right-click your project (CalculatorWSApplication) and
choose New > Web Service.

Click Finish.
  //Add Operations (Methods):
    In the Projects window, right-click the newly created web service and select Add Operation.
Add the following operation:
Name: add

//Remove Default hello() Operation:
In the visual designer, remove the default hello() operation by right-clicking it and selecting Remove Operation.
//Deploy the Web Service
Build and Deploy the Project:
Right-click the project in the Projects window and select Deploy.
NetBeans will compile and deploy the web service to GlassFish.
Test the Web Service:
In the Projects window, expand the Web Services node.
Right-click your web service (CalculatorWS) and select Test Web Service.
A test client window will open in your browser where you can test the add method by providing values for i and j.
// Consume the Web Service
You can now create a client to consume this SOAP-based web service or test it with any SOAP client tool.
